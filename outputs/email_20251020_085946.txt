We're so excited to invite you to our Eid celebration on Saturday, April 20th, starting at 2:00 PM at our place. We can't wait to gather, share a meal, and celebrate together.

Please let us know if you can make it by April 15th so we can finalize the arrangements.

Looking forward to seeing you all!
