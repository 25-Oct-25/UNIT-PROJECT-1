Sleep is essential. You can't function or survive without it. Adults typically need 7 to 9 hours of sleep for maximum brain performance. Too little sleep negatively affects your ability to remember and concentrate. To ensure you're getting enough sleep, practice good sleep hygiene. Put away electronic devices an hour before bedtime and do something relaxing. Avoid stimulants like caffeine in the late afternoon or evening.
