    "Hi everyone, here is my note that is correct and has enough information to about 65% compared to the script. Do you want to share something? let's share together, thanks: \nhow to start a positive day \r\n- First, you need to understand: \"positively\" is \" how to practice it\" - it means \"no one is born with it\"  \r\n - There is the misunderstanding about positive people that \"they never feel bad\" -> X  \r\n=> What do we need to do? \r\n+ \"keeping a small window in your mind\"  from a small quiet effort, from the way showing up \r\n+ notice one good thing a day -> remind your brain that you are not stuck\r\n(it means: we all have good and bad things every day, keep your mind positive by reminding yourself one good thing you've done)  \r\n+ some days are negative -> it is a matter of course because  you are human => it is okay to be negative \r\n+ being gentle to remember: don't need to change your whole life -> let's change one habit => just practice \r\neg. what first thing think when u wake up? -> we should think nothing \r\n-> start in a soft manner \r\n-> at first, don't do much \r\n->can change how we meet the first moment -> it's a power \r\n=> try writing a small sentence that makes u peaceful \r\n-> ask yourself: \" what gives me light? what makes me want to step away from? \"\r\n+ motivation : some days have, but not always -> \"motivation\" is not so effective as gratitude - it means \"just be grateful\"  \r\n=> notice something good, catch small moment and hold in your thought  \r\n-> is not a feeling, is a pause, a momment u say: \"it's okay\" \r\n-> start : say \"thank you\" -> to be positive = thankful \r\n=> \"just one think that makes u move forward\" when one day, u wake up and don't want to do anything \r\n+ want to be better before you try to be better = we always keep in mind that thought => it's a fault (we often imagine one day we will be successful but we act nothing) \r\n=> try to be better every day to reach the achievement",
    "Wowww, Thank uuuu <3",

    "Love your topic today so much. I used to be a negative person for many years, and I truly believed there was no way to change — that negativity was 'who I am' and that I was too old to change it. But I was wrong. The truth is, our brain has neuroplasticity. It can adapt and change at any age, especially when we use affirmations and practice positive thinking. I started applying this to my life about six months ago, and even with small steps each day, I’ve noticed a dramatic change in my entire life.\nEvery morning now, I say to myself: \"Thanks for being alive. Today will be a busy but happy day. You’ve got this!\" That little ritual shifts my whole mindset before the day even begins.\nThank you for this beautiful reminder that positivity is a choice we can return to, again and again, no matter where we start.",
    "That’s such an inspiring transformation 🤍\nI love how you’ve proven to yourself that change is always possible, and your morning affirmation is such a powerful way to set the tone for the day. Thank you for sharing this — it’s a beautiful reminder for all of us.",
    "Good morning Jennie, It's 6:08 AM right now in Vietnam. Thanks for your all sweet and motivated podcasts <3",

    "Great, thanks Jennie!",
    "Hi Jennie, I love your videos. Thank you for the care you put into them. They are so calming!  I loved the message in this one! I started saying \"Thank you\" recently when the green man image appears on the traffic lights and it means I can walk across the street safely. If I am in a rush - or I perceive I am in a rush - waiting can feel like it takes forever! So, when it changes to green, I immediately feel grateful. It's a simple yet powerful thing. Saying it out loud gives it a reality and it goes into my heart that something good has happened. And that in turn gives me a quiet sense of  optimism that somehow everything will be okay! I don't even know when I started doing it. I think I was just so happy one day that I'd finally got the energy and motivation to go out for a walk, that seeing that light change to green was literally like a gift from my Angels to let me know that I was being helped even when I felt depressed! So, you are totally right Jennie, we should  never underestimate the power gratitude can have in our day and in our lives, it is transformative! I hope you have a good day, from Courtenay Rhennick.",
    "That’s such a beautiful story, Courtenay 🤍\nI love how you’ve turned such a small, everyday moment into a reminder of gratitude and hope. Those little sparks really can shift our whole mood and mindset. Thank you for sharing this — it’s such a gentle but powerful example of how we can find light in the smallest things.",
