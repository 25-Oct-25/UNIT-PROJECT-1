# Description: Background loop that builds a weekly PDF and emails it at a scheduled day/time.

def start_report_scheduler_email(get_state, build_pdf_func, email_func, interval_sec: int = 30):
    """Start a background scheduler for weekly PDF email.

    The loop checks the current day/time every `interval_sec` seconds.
    When it matches a job schedule, it builds the PDF and sends it by email,
    then records `last_sent_date` to avoid sending twice in the same day.

    Args:
        get_state (Callable[[], Any]): Function that returns the current app state.
            Expected fields on state:
              - email_to (str): Recipient address.
              - email_from (str|None): Sender address (optional).
              - report_schedules (list[dict]): Each job may include:

                        "time_hhmm": "HH:MM",
                        "days": int,                 # Days to include in the PDF (default 7)
                        "file": str,                 # Output filename (default "week_report.pdf")
                        "subject": str,              # Email subject
                        "text": str,                 # Email body
                        "last_sent_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Auto-updated
                    }
        build_pdf_func (Callable[[Any, str, int], None]): Function to build the PDF:
            (state, output_path, days) -> None.
        email_func (Callable[[str, str, str, list[str], str|None], str]): Function to send email:
            (to, subject, body, attachments, from_addr) -> "OK".
        interval_sec (int): Sleep interval between checks.

    Returns:
        threading.Thread: The started daemon thread.
